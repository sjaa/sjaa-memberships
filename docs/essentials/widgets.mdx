## Overview

Widgets are embeddable components that allow you to display membership data on external websites, such as the main SJAA website, Google Sites, or other platforms. These lightweight, self-contained displays automatically update with current information from the membership database.

Widgets are designed to:
* Display real-time information from the membership database
* Embed seamlessly into external websites
* Update automatically without manual intervention
* Provide a professional, polished appearance
* Work across different platforms and content management systems

## Available Widgets

### Meetup Events Widget

The Meetup Events widget displays upcoming events from the SJAA Meetup.com page directly on your website.

**Features:**
* Shows the next 10 upcoming Meetup events
* Displays event images (if available)
* Shows event title, date, and time
* Clickable links to the Meetup.com event page for RSVP
* Automatically updates as new events are added
* Shows times in Pacific Time Zone
* Displays a placeholder message when no events are scheduled

**What's Displayed:**
* **Event Image**: Photo from Meetup.com (or a moon/stars icon if none)
* **Event Title**: The name of the event
* **Date**: Full date in format "Monday, January 15, 2025"
* **Time**: Start time with timezone (e.g., "7:00 PM PST")
* **Link**: Direct link to RSVP on Meetup.com

**How It Works:**
The widget connects to the membership database, which is automatically synchronized with Meetup.com through the Calendar Sync Job (see [Recurring Tasks](recurring-tasks)). When new Meetup events are created or updated, they're automatically reflected in the widget within 24 hours.

## How to Use Widgets

### Embedding on a Website

To embed a widget on your website or Google Site:

#### Step 1: Get the Widget URL

Each widget has a unique URL:

**Meetup Events Widget:**
```
https://membership.sjaa.net/widgets/meetup
```

#### Step 2: Create an Embed Code

Use an iframe to embed the widget:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://membership.sjaa.net/widgets/meetup"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="auto"
  style="border: none;">
</iframe>
```

#### Step 3: Add to Your Website

**For Google Sites:**
1. Edit the page where you want the widget
2. Click the "Insert" menu
3. Select "Embed"
4. Paste the iframe code
5. Click "Insert" or "Embed"
6. Adjust the size as needed
7. Save the page

**For WordPress:**
1. Edit the page or post
2. Add a "Custom HTML" block
3. Paste the iframe code
4. Preview to verify appearance
5. Publish the page

**For Other Platforms:**
Most modern content management systems support iframe embeds. Look for:
* "HTML" or "Custom HTML" blocks
* "Embed" or "iFrame" options
* "Code" or "Raw HTML" editing modes

### Customizing Widget Appearance

You can customize the widget's display using iframe parameters:

**Width:**
* Use `width="100%"` to fill the container
* Use `width="400"` for a fixed pixel width
* Widgets are responsive and adapt to container width

**Height:**
* Default: `height="600"` for Meetup widget
* Adjust based on how many events you expect
* Each event takes approximately 100-120 pixels
* Too small causes scrolling; too large leaves empty space

**Border:**
* `frameborder="0"` removes the default iframe border
* Use CSS styling on the iframe element for custom borders

**Scrolling:**
* `scrolling="auto"` shows scrollbar only when needed
* `scrolling="yes"` always shows scrollbar
* `scrolling="no"` hides scrollbar (may cut off content)

**Example - Customized Embed:**
```html
<iframe
  src="https://membership.sjaa.net/widgets/meetup"
  width="400"
  height="800"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="auto"
  style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">
</iframe>
```

   * Event title
   * Date and time
   * Meetup.com URL
   * Event image (if available)
   * Unique Meetup ID

### Event Display

Each event in the widget shows:
