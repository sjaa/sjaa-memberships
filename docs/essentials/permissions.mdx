## Overview

The membership management application uses a comprehensive role-based permission system to control access to features and data. This ensures that sensitive member information is protected while allowing authorized administrators to perform their duties effectively.

## User Types

There are two distinct types of users in the system:

### Members (People)
Regular members can log in to the application to:
* View and update their own profile information
* Renew their membership
* Manage their contact details, interests, and equipment
* View their membership history and donation records

Members can only access their own information and cannot view or edit other members' data.

### Administrators (Admins)
Administrators are staff or volunteers who manage the organization's membership database. Admins have special permissions based on their role, which determines what actions they can perform in the system.

## Permission Levels

The system uses four distinct permission levels that can be assigned to administrators:

### Read Permission
Allows viewing member data and generating reports. Administrators with read permission can:
* Browse the member directory
* Search for members
* View individual member profiles
* Access reports (Ephemeris subscribers, renewal reminders, membership statistics)
* View equipment inventory
* See donation records
* View groups and their members

**Cannot**: Edit any data, create new records, or delete information

### Write Permission
Allows creating and editing data. Administrators with write permission can:
* All actions from read permission
* Create and edit member records
* Add and modify memberships (including offline renewals)
* Record donations
* Manage equipment inventory
* Add members to groups
* Send renewal reminder emails
* Send welcome emails to new members
* Integrate with Google Workspace (sync groups, manage calendars)
* Import data via CSV

**Cannot**: Manage other administrators or assign permissions

### Permit Permission
The highest level of access for managing administrators. Administrators with permit permission can:
* All actions from read and write permissions
* Create new administrator accounts
* Edit existing administrator accounts
* Assign permissions to other administrators
* Remove administrators from the system

This permission should only be given to trusted staff who are responsible for managing the administrator team.

### Verify Members Permission
A specialized permission for verifying member status. Administrators with this permission can:
* Access the member verification interface
* Confirm membership status for access to club resources

This permission is useful for volunteers who need to check membership status at events but don't need full read access to all member data.

## Permission Assignment

Only administrators with the `permit` permission can assign or modify permissions for other administrators. To manage permissions:

1. Navigate to the Admins section
2. Select an administrator to edit
3. Check or uncheck the desired permissions
4. Save the changes

An administrator can have multiple permissions. For example, someone might have both `read` and `write` permissions, giving them the ability to view and edit data, but not manage other administrators.

## Access Control Implementation

The application uses Pundit policies to enforce permissions throughout the system. Each controller action checks whether the current user has the required permission before allowing access. If a user attempts to access a feature they don't have permission for, they will receive an authorization error.

### Examples of Permission Requirements

**Viewing Reports**: Requires `read` permission
**Editing Member Information**: Requires `write` permission (or being the member themselves)
**Creating a New Admin**: Requires `permit` permission
**Verifying a Member at an Event**: Requires `verify_members` or `read` permission

## Security Best Practices

When managing administrator permissions:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum permissions necessary for each administrator's role
2. **Permit Permission**: Limit `permit` permission to only 1-2 senior staff members
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review administrator accounts and remove access for former volunteers
4. **Strong Passwords**: Ensure all administrators use strong, unique passwords
5. **Password Resets**: Use the secure password reset flow rather than sharing passwords

## Authentication

Both members and administrators use email-based authentication with secure password hashing. The system includes:

* Password reset functionality via email
* Secure session management
* API key authentication for programmatic access
* Integration with Google OAuth for Google Workspace features

## Data Protection

Member data is protected through:

* Encrypted passwords using bcrypt
* Secure session cookies
* HTTPS encryption in production
* Database-level access controls
* Input validation and sanitization
* Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
