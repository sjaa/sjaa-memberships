## Overview

The membership database keeps Google Groups synchronized with current membership status. This ensures that only active members have access to member-only email lists and resources.

The primary use case is maintaining the **members@sjaa.net** Google Group, which serves as the main communication channel for active members.

## How It Works

### Automatic Addition

When members sign up or renew their membership:
* Their email address is **automatically added** to members@sjaa.net
* This happens immediately upon successful payment
* New members receive access to member communications right away
* No manual intervention required

### Manual Removal

To remove expired members from the Google Group:
* An administrator must **manually run** the synchronization job
* This is done periodically (typically monthly or as needed)
* The sync removes members whose memberships have expired
* This process is intentionally manual to allow grace periods

## Running the Synchronization

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Authentication**: Administrator must authenticate with Google
2. **Write Permission**: Requires the `write` permission in the membership database
3. **Google Workspace Access**: Must have permissions to manage the Google Group

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Navigate to Google Groups**
   * Log in to the membership database as an administrator
   * Go to the Google integration section
   * Select "Google Groups"

2. **Authenticate with Google**
   * If not already authenticated, click "Authenticate with Google"
   * Grant the necessary permissions
   * You'll be redirected back to the application

3. **Select the Group**
   * Choose "Members" (members@sjaa.net) from the list
   * Or select another group with an email address configured

4. **Compute Difference**
   * Click "Compute Difference"
   * The system compares:
     * **Active members** in the database
     * **Current members** of the Google Group
   * Shows who will be added and removed

5. **Review Changes**
   * **People to Add**: Active members not in Google Group
   * **People to Remove**: Google Group members whose memberships expired
   * Review the lists carefully before proceeding

6. **Sync the Group**
   * Choose one of two options:
     * **Sync (Add and Remove)**: Adds new members AND removes expired members
     * **Sync (Add Only)**: Adds new members but keeps expired members
   * Click the appropriate button
   * Confirm the action

7. **Verify Results**
   * The system shows how many people were added and removed
   * Check the results to ensure sync completed successfully

## Synchronization Options

### Add and Remove (Full Sync)
**When to Use:**
* Monthly maintenance
* After membership renewal cycles
* When cleaning up the group

**What It Does:**
* Adds active members missing from Google Group
* Removes expired members from Google Group
* Brings group into complete alignment with database

**Recommended** for regular maintenance.

### Add Only
**When to Use:**
* During grace periods
* When you want to be more cautious
* Immediately after a membership drive

**What It Does:**
* Adds active members missing from Google Group
* Leaves all existing Google Group members unchanged
* Does NOT remove expired members

Use when you want to give expired members extra time before removal.

## What Gets Synchronized

### Members@sjaa.net Group

**Added to Group:**
* All people with **active memberships**
* Membership must not be expired
* Email address must be in the database

**Removed from Group:**
* People whose memberships have **expired**
* No current active membership
* Based on membership end date

### Other Groups

The sync system also works with other database groups that have email addresses configured:

**Added to Group:**
* People assigned to the group in the database
* If group is "members only": must also have active membership

**Removed from Group:**
* People not assigned to the group in the database
* If group is "members only": people with expired memberships

## Best Practices

### Timing

**Run synchronization:**
* **Monthly**: On or after the 1st of each month (after automatic renewal reminders)
* **After major events**: Following membership drives or renewal campaigns
* **Before important communications**: Prior to sending member-only announcements
* **During grace periods**: Use "Add Only" to avoid immediately removing recently expired members

**Don't run too frequently:**
* No need to sync daily or weekly
* Monthly is typically sufficient
* Automatic additions handle new members immediately

### Grace Periods

Consider giving members a grace period before removing them:
* Use "Add Only" sync for the first month after expiration
* After 1-2 months, use full "Add and Remove" sync
* This allows time for late renewals
* Provides better member experience

### Communication

Before removing expired members:
* Ensure renewal reminders have been sent (see [Recurring Tasks](recurring-tasks))
* Allow sufficient time for members to renew
* Consider sending a final notification before removal

### Verification

After synchronization:
* Review the results shown on screen
* Check that the numbers make sense
* Spot-check a few members to verify correct status
* Keep records of sync dates for reference

## Google Groups Management

Beyond synchronization, administrators can:
* **Import members from CSV**: Add members to groups in bulk (see [Groups](groups))
* **View group members**: See current Google Group membership
* **Manage multiple groups**: Sync any group with an email address configured

For groups other than members@sjaa.net:
1. Create the group in the database with an email address
2. Assign people to the group
3. Use the same sync process to maintain the Google Group

## Related Features

* **Automatic Addition**: New members added to groups when they sign up or renew
* **Renewal Reminders**: Automated emails to members approaching expiration (see [Recurring Tasks](recurring-tasks))
* **Group Management**: Assigning members to groups in the database (see [Groups](groups))
* **Membership Reports**: Track membership status and renewals (see [Reports](reports))

## Summary

Google Group synchronization keeps communication channels current by:
* **Automatically adding** new and renewing members to groups
* Providing a **manual process** to remove expired members with appropriate grace periods
* Offering **flexible options** (add-only vs. full sync) for different situations
* Working with **any group** that has an email address configured

This hybrid approach ensures new members get immediate access while giving administrators control over when expired members are removed, allowing for grace periods and careful communication management.
