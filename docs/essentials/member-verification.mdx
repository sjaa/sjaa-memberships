## Overview

Member verification allows authorized users to quickly check whether someone has an active membership. This is useful for:

* Checking members at events (star parties, meetings, etc.)
* Verifying access to member-only resources
* Confirming membership status at the door
* Quick lookup without exposing sensitive member data

The system provides two different verification methods depending on your permission level and needs.

## For Administrators: Using the People Search

Administrators with **read** permission can verify membership status using the comprehensive People search page. This method provides full member details and is ideal for administrative tasks.

### Accessing People Search

1. Log in as an administrator with read permission
2. Navigate to **People** from the main menu
3. The People search page appears with search and filter options

### Quick Verification by Email

The fastest way to verify a member:

1. In the "More Filters" section, enter the member's email address in the **Email** field
2. The search updates automatically as you type
3. Review the results:
   * **Active members**: Highlighted in green with "Active" badge
   * **Expired members**: Standard display without active badge
   * **Not found**: No results appear

### Verification Search Options

The People search provides multiple ways to find and verify members:

#### Basic Search
Use the main search bar at the top to search across:
* First name
* Last name
* Email address
* Phone number
* City
* Notes

Simply type any identifying information and the system will find matching members.

#### Advanced Filters
Click "More Filters" to access additional search criteria:

**Personal Information:**
* **First Name**: Member's first name
* **Last Name**: Member's last name
* **Email**: Email address (most reliable for verification)
* **Phone**: Phone number

**Location:**
* **City**: Member's city
* **State**: Member's state

**Membership Status:**
* **Active Members**: Filter to show only currently active members
  * Select "Yes" to show only active members
  * Select "No" to show only expired members
  * Select "Either" to show all members

**Other Filters:**
* **Interests**: Astronomy interests (astrophotography, planets, etc.)
* **Groups**: Organizational groups or committees
* **Skills**: Volunteer skills
* **Ephemeris Subscription**: Printed or digital newsletter preference
* **Volunteer Status**: Whether the member volunteers
* **Mentor Status**: Whether the member mentors
* **Astrobin Username**: Astrophotography platform username
* **Telescopius Username**: Astronomy platform username

### Reading Verification Results

When you find a member in the search results, you can see:

* **Name**: Linked to their full profile
* **Membership Status**:
  * Active memberships are highlighted in **green**
  * Active members show an **"Active" badge**
  * Expired members have no highlighting
* **Contact Information**: Email and other contact details (in full profile)
* **Membership Dates**: Start and end dates (in full profile)

### Detailed Verification

To see complete membership details:

1. Click on the member's name in the search results
2. Their profile page opens, showing:
   * Full membership history with dates
   * Current membership status
   * Expiration date (or "Lifetime" for lifetime members)
   * Donation history
   * Contact information
   * Groups and interests

### Best Practices for Admin Verification

**For Event Check-In:**
1. Keep a tablet or laptop with the People search page open
2. Search by email address as members arrive
3. Look for the green highlight and "Active" badge
4. Grant access to active members

**For Access Control:**
1. Use the "Active Members" filter set to "Yes"
2. Search for the specific member
3. If they appear in results, they're active
4. If no results, membership has expired

**Privacy Considerations:**
* The People search shows detailed member information
* Only use for legitimate verification purposes
* Don't share search results with unauthorized individuals
* Admins see all member data—handle responsibly

## For Verifiers: Using the Membership Verification Page

Users with the **verify_members** permission have access to a specialized verification page designed specifically for quick membership checks without exposing detailed member information.

### Who Should Use This Method

The verification page is ideal for:
* **Event volunteers** checking members at the door
* **Staff** without full admin access
* **Greeters** at star parties or meetings
* Anyone who needs to verify membership without accessing full member profiles

### Accessing the Verification Page

1. Log in with an account that has the `verify_members` permission
2. Navigate to the **Membership Verification** page
3. You'll see a simple form with an email address field

### How to Verify a Member

The verification process is straightforward:

1. **Enter Email Address**
   * Ask the person for the email address they used to register
   * Type or paste the email into the "Email Address" field
   * Click "Verify Membership"

2. **Review the Result**

The system displays one of three outcomes:

#### Valid Member (Active)
A **green success message** appears with:
* ✓ **"Valid Member"** heading with green checkmark
* **Membership expires**: Shows the month and year (e.g., "December 2025")
* **Timestamp**: When the verification was performed

**Example:**
```
✓ Valid Member
Membership expires: December 2025
Verified on November 26, 2025 at 2:30 PM
```

#### Invalid Member (Expired)
A **red error message** appears with:
* ✗ **"No member found with this email address"** or expiration details
* Information about when the membership expired
* **Timestamp**: When the verification was attempted

**Example:**
```
✗ Membership Expired
Expired: June 2024
Attempted on November 26, 2025 at 2:30 PM
```

#### No Member Found
A **red error message** appears with:
* ✗ **"No member found with this email address"**
* This means the email is not in the system
* The person may have used a different email or is not a member
* **Timestamp**: When the verification was attempted

### Features of the Verification Page

**Privacy-Focused:**
* Shows only membership status (active or expired)
* Shows only expiration month and year
* Does NOT show:
  * Member's name
  * Full contact information
  * Donation history
  * Other personal details

**Quick and Simple:**
* Single field form for fast lookups
* Immediate results
* No complex filters or options
* Perfect for event check-in stations

**Timestamped:**
* Each verification shows when it was performed
* Useful for audit trails or dispute resolution
* Helps track verification activity

**Real-Time:**
* Checks current membership status from the database
* Always shows the most up-to-date information
* No caching or delayed updates

### Best Practices for Verification Page Use

**Setting Up at Events:**
1. Open the verification page on a tablet or laptop
2. Position it at the entry point
3. Have members provide their email address
4. Verify and grant access to valid members

**Handling Edge Cases:**

**Wrong Email Address:**
* If no member found, ask if they used a different email
* Try variations (work vs. personal email)
* If still not found, direct to admin for manual verification

**Expired Membership:**
* Politely inform the member their membership has expired
* Offer information about renewing
* May allow entry with payment of membership at the door (depending on policy)

**Lifetime Members:**
* Shows "Lifetime" instead of an expiration date
* Always valid, never expires

**Technical Issues:**
* Keep a backup list of current members (CSV export)
* Have admin contact available for problem cases
* Consider offline verification method as fallback

**Privacy and Security:**
* Don't read email addresses aloud in crowded areas
* Don't share verification results with others nearby
* Clear the screen between verifications for privacy
* Log out when leaving the station unattended

### Verification Page Workflow Example

**Scenario: Star Party Check-In**

1. **Member arrives**: "Hi, I'm here for the star party"
2. **Verifier**: "Great! Can I have your email address to verify your membership?"
3. **Member provides**: "john.doe@example.com"
4. **Verifier enters** email and clicks "Verify Membership"
5. **System shows**: ✓ Valid Member, Membership expires: March 2026
6. **Verifier**: "Perfect, you're all set! Enjoy the event!"

**Scenario: Expired Membership**

1. **Member arrives** and provides email
2. **Verifier enters** email and clicks "Verify Membership"
3. **System shows**: ✗ Membership Expired: August 2024
4. **Verifier**: "It looks like your membership expired in August. You can renew online at sjaa.net or we can help you renew right here."
5. **Option A**: Member renews on-site (if policy allows)
6. **Option B**: Member is given renewal information for later
