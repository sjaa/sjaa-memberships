## Overview

The equipment tracking system provides comprehensive inventory management for all organizational property. This powerful tool allows you to catalog, search, and track equipment ownership, condition, and location.

For SJAA, this includes (but is not limited to):
* **Optical Equipment**: Telescopes, binoculars, eyepieces, finderscopes, filters
* **Mounts and Accessories**: Telescope mounts, tripods, counterweights, adapter rings
* **Imaging Equipment**: Cameras, autoguiders, filter wheels, field flatteners
* **Electronics**: Computers, tablets, projectors, batteries, cables, power supplies
* **Event Equipment**: Tents, tables, chairs, signs, banners
* **Educational Materials**: Books, star charts, demonstration models
* **Anything else** that is property of the club and worth keeping track of

## Permissions

Managing equipment requires the **write** permission. Permissions can be assigned by administrators with the `permit` permission. Once you have the appropriate permission, navigate to the Equipment page by selecting "Equipment" from the main menu.

**Permission Levels:**
* **Read**: View equipment inventory and search
* **Write**: Add, edit, and delete equipment entries
* **Permit**: Assign equipment management permissions to others

## Equipment Page Overview

The Equipment page provides a search interface at the top and a list of equipment below. The page updates dynamically as you search and filter.

## Understanding Equipment vs. Instruments

The system uses a two-level structure to efficiently track equipment:

### Instruments
An **instrument** is a type or model of equipment. It represents the general category and specifications:
* **Kind**: The category of equipment (e.g., "Telescope", "Eyepiece", "Camera")
* **Model**: The brand and specific model (e.g., "Meade LX500", "Orion 80mm Binoculars")

Think of an instrument as the "what" - what type of item it is.

### Equipment
An **equipment** record represents a specific physical item. Multiple equipment records can share the same instrument:
* If you have two identical Orion 80mm binoculars, they're the **same instrument** but **two different equipment** entries
* Each equipment entry tracks the specific item's owner, condition, location, and images

Think of equipment as the "which one" - which specific instance of that instrument.

**Example:**
```
Instrument: Telescope / Celestron NexStar 8SE
  └─ Equipment #1: Owned by John Smith, located at site A, excellent condition
  └─ Equipment #2: Owned by Imaging Program, located at site B, needs cleaning
```

This structure allows you to:
* Track multiple identical items separately
* Search for all equipment of a particular type
* Avoid re-entering instrument specifications for each item

## Creating Equipment Entries

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Click "New Equipment"** on the Equipment page

2. **Define the Instrument**
   * **Kind**: Select or enter the equipment category
     * Examples: Telescope, Mount, Camera, Eyepiece, Binoculars, Tripod, Battery
     * The system auto-suggests existing kinds as you type
   * **Model**: Enter the brand and model name
     * Examples: "Celestron C8", "Orion SkyQuest XT10", "Canon EOS 6D"
     * Be specific to help identify the exact equipment type

3. **Assign Ownership**

   Equipment can have two types of owners (both optional):

   * **Person Owner**: The individual who physically possesses or is responsible for the equipment
     * Select from the dropdown of all members
     * Use this for equipment loaned to members
     * The person can see this equipment in their profile

   * **Group Owner**: The program, committee, or organizational unit that owns the equipment
     * Select from the dropdown of all groups
     * Examples: "Imaging Program", "School Outreach", "Star Party Team"
     * Use this for equipment that belongs to a program rather than an individual

   * **Both**: Equipment can have both a person and group owner
     * Example: An Imaging Program camera currently checked out to Jane Doe

   * **Neither**: Equipment with no owner is tracked as general club property

4. **Add Description**
   * **Note**: Enter any relevant information about this specific item
     * Condition: "Excellent", "Good", "Needs repair", "Minor scratches on tube"
     * Location: "Stored in cabinet A", "At Houge Park site"
     * Serial number: "SN: 12345678"
     * Accessories included: "Includes hard case and foam inserts"
     * Usage restrictions: "For advanced users only"
     * Maintenance history: "Collimated 11/2024", "Cleaned mirrors 06/2024"

5. **Upload Images**
   * Click the image upload field
   * Select one or more image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
   * Multiple images can be attached to document:
     * Overall condition
     * Close-up details
     * Damage or wear
     * Included accessories
     * Setup or configuration
   * Images are automatically resized for optimal storage
   * Thumbnails are generated for quick viewing

6. **Add Tags**
   * Tags help organize and group equipment
   * Enter multiple tags to make equipment easier to find
   * Tag examples:
     * **By set**: "Loaner Kit #1", "School Outreach Set"
     * **By condition**: "Needs Repair", "Excellent Condition"
     * **By location**: "Storage Unit A", "Houge Park"
     * **By use case**: "Beginner Friendly", "Advanced", "Solar Safe"
     * **By availability**: "Available for Loan", "Display Only"
   * Tags are searchable and filterable
   * Equipment can have multiple tags

7. **Save**
   * Click "Create Equipment" to save the entry
   * The equipment appears in the inventory list
   * You can edit it at any time

## Searching and Filtering Equipment

The Equipment page provides powerful search capabilities:

### Filter by Person Owner
* Select a person from the dropdown
* Shows all equipment owned or checked out to that person
* Useful for:
  * Tracking what equipment is loaned out
  * Finding all items a specific member has
  * Inventory audits per person

### Filter by Group Owner
* Select a group from the dropdown
* Shows all equipment owned by that program or committee
* Useful for:
  * Program-specific inventory (e.g., all Imaging Program gear)
  * Budget tracking per committee
  * Equipment allocation across programs

### Filter by Instrument Kind
* Select a kind from the dropdown (e.g., "Telescope", "Camera")
* Shows all equipment of that type
* The dropdown includes all kinds currently in the database
* Useful for:
  * Finding all telescopes
  * Counting equipment by category
  * Category-specific inventory checks

### Filter by Tags
* Select one or more tags
* Choose "And" or "Or" operation:
  * **And**: Equipment must have ALL selected tags
  * **Or**: Equipment must have ANY selected tags
* Useful for:
  * Finding equipment in a specific set
  * Filtering by condition or availability
  * Location-based searches

### Combining Filters
* All filters work together
* Example: Find all telescopes owned by the Star Party Team that are tagged "Available for Loan"
* Clear filters by refreshing the page or selecting empty values

* Helps track program budgets and assets
* Useful for organizational inventory
* See [Groups](groups) for more information about groups

### Transferring Ownership
To transfer equipment from one person/group to another:

2. Change the person or group owner
3. Save the changes
4. The equipment now appears under the new owner

### Equipment Without Owners
Equipment with no assigned owner:
* Represents general club property
* Available in the pool for assignment
* Stored at the club's main location

## Tags and Organization

### Creating Tags
Tags are created automatically when you enter them on equipment:
* Enter a new tag name when editing equipment
* The system creates the tag if it doesn't exist
* Tags are reusable across all equipment

### Tag Strategies

## Database Representation

An equipment record contains:

* An internal `id`
* A reference to an **instrument** (kind + model)
* An optional **person owner** (foreign key to people table)
* An optional **group owner** (foreign key to groups table)
* A `note` field for condition, location, and other details
* Zero or more **images** (via Active Storage attachments)
* Zero or more **tags** (many-to-many relationship)
* Zero or more **donation items** linking to donation records

An instrument record contains:

* An internal `id`
* A `kind` (equipment category)
* A `model` (brand and model name)
* Relationships to all equipment using this instrument

This structure allows efficient searching, prevents duplicate instrument data, and maintains clear ownership and organization.
