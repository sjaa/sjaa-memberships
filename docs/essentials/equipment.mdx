This app has the ability to catalog, describe, and search for equipment in use by your organization.  For SJAA, this may
include, but is not limited to: telescopes, mounts, tripods, cameras, eye pieces, binoculars, projectors, computers, batteries,
and anything else that is property of the club and worth keeping track of.

Adding equipment requires the "equipment write permission."  Permissions can be assigned by administrators with the `permit` permission.
Once you have the appropriate permission, navigate to the Equipment page by selecting the "Equipment" link in the menu.  The look and feel
may change over time, but it will look something like this:

On this page you can search for equipment using the filters at the top.  Below, the equipment matching those filters is populated.  You 
can create a new Equipment entry by clicking on the "New Equipment" button. Equipment has the following properties:

* A [Person](people) "owner."  This represents the person who physically has the equipment or is otherwise responsible for it.
* A [Role](roles) "owner."  This represents the group or program that the equipment belongs to.  For example, a camera my belong to the Hands-On Imaging Program (a potential Role).
* An instrument.  A single Instrument "has many" Equipment.  That is, the club may have two pairs of Orion 80mm binoculars, which would be the same instrument, but two different pieces of equipment.
  * The instrument has a "Kind," which describes what type of object it is.  i.e. Telescope or Eyepiece
  * The instrument also has a "Model," which describes the brand and specifics of the instrument.  i.e. "Meade LX500"
* A note.  The note is used to describe anything interesting about the equipment, like its condition or location.
* Images.  A picture is worth a thousand words, so each equipment record can have many images associated with it.
* Tags.  Tags help to group like items together.  For example, if different equipment is part of a set, then they could be tagged with the name of the set.  Equipment can have many tags, and they are searchable.
