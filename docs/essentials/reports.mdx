## Overview

The reporting system provides administrators with powerful tools to analyze membership trends, track renewals, and generate mailing lists. These reports help with membership outreach, financial tracking, and organizational planning.

Accessing reports requires the "read" permission. Some report actions (like sending emails or creating Google Groups) require the "write" permission. Permissions can be assigned by administrators with the `permit` permission.
