    <h2>About the Archive</h2>

    <p>
      For decades, the San Jose Astronomical Association has published
      <em>The Ephemeris</em>, a newsletter featuring science, astronomy, and club-related
      articles written by SJAA members. These issues represent a rich history of the club's
      activities, discoveries, and community.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2004, for the SJAA's 50th anniversary, club president Mike Koop undertook the
      enormous task of scanning, cleaning, and indexing decades of <em>Ephemeris</em> issues and club documents.
      Working from a collection assembled by Jim Van Nuland &mdash; who had been gathering
      and photocopying issues since 1975 &mdash; Mike digitized every available issue, creating
      a permanent record of the club's publishing history.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Document Archive picks up where Mike left off, making the contents available in a categorized and searchable
      format online. Every scanned issue has
      been preserved in its original PDF format, and the content has also been converted into
      readable text so you can search and browse individual articles.  The Document Archive will hopefully
      be maintained and augmented with additional club documents as time goes on.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use the Archive</h2>

    <h3>Searching</h3>

    <p>
      The archive offers two ways to search for content:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI-Powered Semantic Search</strong> &mdash; This is the default search mode. Instead of
        looking for exact words, it understands the <em>meaning</em> of what you're looking for.
        For example, searching for "planets visible tonight" will find articles about planetary
        observation even if they don't use those exact words. This is a great way to explore
        topics when you're not sure exactly what to search for.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content Search</strong> &mdash; This is a traditional keyword search that looks for
        the exact words you type. Use this when you know the specific term, name, or phrase
        you're looking for.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Browsing</h3>

    <p>
      You can also explore the archive without searching:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Categories</strong> &mdash; Articles are organized by topic, so you can browse
        everything in a particular subject area, such as observing reports, club news, or
        equipment reviews.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keywords</strong> &mdash; Each article is tagged with relevant keywords, making
        it easy to find related content by clicking on a keyword that interests you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Viewing Documents</h3>

    <p>
      When you find an article you'd like to read, you have several options:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Original PDF</strong> &mdash; View the original scanned document exactly as it
        appeared in print. This preserves the original layout, images, and formatting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Markdown and Text</strong> &mdash; Each document has also been converted into
        plain text and formatted text versions. These are easier to read on screen and work
        well on mobile devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Foreword by Mike Koop</h2>

    <blockquote class="ps-3" style="border-left: 4px solid #dee2e6;">
      <p>
        I first noticed that the SJAA's Fiftieth anniversary was coming up about two years ago. What could we do to recognize such an important occasion? I have been a member of the club since 1989. Ever since I have joined, when the Ephemeris came in the mail, I dropped everything to read the issue. We have been very fortunate to have many excellent editors of the newsletter and many members who have described their projects which has kept the newsletter a central focus of the club. I decided that the best present of all would be to allow our current members to read these great old issues by putting them on a CD Rom.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has not been to easy a task. First of all, Jim Van Nuland has collected as many copies of the Ephemeris as he could. Back in 1975, a call was made in the newsletter for copies of old issues which he photocopied when he worked for IBM. We now have every issue solid back to 1975, and spotty coverage back to 1970. We also recovered an old SJAA scrapbook, which documented the first three years of the club, and included some board meeting notes and newspaper clippings to 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
        Move forward to 2004. At work, I had access to a Canon Document Scanner, which allowed easy scanning with a page feeder at 300 dpi. The native format for the scanner is a multipage TIFF format. That format is not too compatible with many computer platforms, so I decided to convert all the files to PDF. Adobe's PDF format allows users to have complete control over the viewing and printing of the document. Another advantage is that almost every platform has a PDF reader integrated with a web viewer, so I could use web pages to navigate and view the scans. From there it was a massive clean up job. I needed to remove staple marks, mailing labels, ditto run overs, and a few "Jim Van Doodles". Occasionally, the issues were printed in a booklet form so I needed to reorder the sheets from the scans. Color paper never seems to scan cleanly, so I have used a few tools from Paintshop Pro to clean up the noise.

        This is the first issue of this disk to be presented at the 50th Anniversary Celebration at the December General Meeting of the Club in 2004. Over the next year, I would like to continue this effort by doing an Optical Character Recognition of all the issues, possibly putting them all on the web for indexing, or getting them added to NASA's ADS database. The format of the disk allows us to add the web pages just like the current issues of the Ephemeris on the web. Please let me know if you would be willing to help continue this effort. Over the next year, I would like to collect your memories. What was your favorite meeting or Event? What makes you proud to say you are a member of our organization? Do you have any pictures of past events? We can scan those also to be included with the next issues of this disk Also, if there are any problems with the disk, let me know what the problem is and which platform/browser you are using.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy this disk!
